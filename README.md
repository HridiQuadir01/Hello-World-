# Hello-World-
My 1st C# code
Hello World! Well, it's really nice to meet you all.
I am a freaking fan of racing games and I am not just into playing games I want to make games more racing games to be exact.
I want to make these games all of the games especially on Windows for big computer screens for users to play.
Well if you didn't play in computers, then I am sorry you didn't play at all with tech.
With C# & front end developing in video games on Windows computer and by the help of Unity Engine besides, I am ready to dive in & be part of this amazing team.
So GAME ON TEAMS.
